# CayleyPy Pancake

Modular ML framework for learning heuristics in the Pancake Sorting problem
via Cayley graph exploration and beam search.

This repository refactors a research-heavy notebook into a structured
Python package with:

- classical baseline heuristics
- beam search with handcrafted heuristics
- ML-based heuristic learning (PyTorch)
- resumeable training & submission generation
- submission merging utilities
